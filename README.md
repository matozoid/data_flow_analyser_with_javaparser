# Data Flow Analyser with JavaParser
Builds data flow graphs from source code parsed with JavaParser.

Right now it is an unfinished experiment, 
not all Java constructs are handled, including common ones.

You can look at the source code to see a way of implementing an algorithm like this,
or help me fix issues.
