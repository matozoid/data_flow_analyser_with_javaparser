# Control Flow Analyser with JavaParser
Builds control flow graphs from source code parsed with JavaParser.

A few things are missing, see the issue list.

It would be best to look at https://github.com/daanvdh/JavaDataFlow instead,
since this project is not getting cared for as well as it should be.
